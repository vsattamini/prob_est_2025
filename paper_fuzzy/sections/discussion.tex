% Discussion for fuzzy logic paper

\noindent
% Interpret the fuzzy classification results.  Reflect on the ease of
% constructing membership functions from quantiles and the automatic
% determination of orientation based on class medians.  Discuss how the
% fuzzy system handles uncertainty and borderline cases more gracefully
% than crisp classifiers.  Highlight which features exerted the strongest
% influence on the fuzzy decisions (e.g. high burstiness favouring human,
% high n–gram repetition favouring LLM) and how this aligns with
% expectations.

% Acknowledge limitations: the simplistic rule base and equal weighting
% across features may not capture complex interactions; membership
% functions derived from quantiles assume unimodal distributions; the
% approach currently supports only two classes.  Suggest improvements,
% such as using expert knowledge to design rules, adopting adaptive
% weighting schemes, or combining fuzzy inference with statistical
% classifiers in a hybrid model.
