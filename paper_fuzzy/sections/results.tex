% Results for fuzzy logic paper

\noindent
% Present the performance of the fuzzy classifier.  Include tables summarising
% cross–validated accuracy, ROC AUC and average precision.  Plot membership
% functions for a few representative features to illustrate how the 33rd
% and 66th percentiles determine the "low", "medium" and "high" sets.  Show
% an example inference trajectory: for a selected text, display its
% feature values, the membership degrees for each feature, the aggregated
% human and LLM scores and the final classification.

% Compare fuzzy logic performance to the statistical classifiers.  Discuss
% similarities and differences: fuzzy inference may yield slightly lower
% discriminative power but provides interpretable degrees of belief.
