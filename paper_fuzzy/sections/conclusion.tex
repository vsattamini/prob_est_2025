% Conclusion for fuzzy logic paper

\noindent
% Summarise the contributions of applying fuzzy set theory to stylometric
% classification.  Emphasise that by reusing the same feature set
% extracted for the statistical analysis, the fuzzy approach provided
% additional interpretability and a complementary perspective on the
% data.  Conclude that fuzzy inference is a viable tool for
% approximate reasoning in text analysis and point to future work on
% refining membership functions and integrating fuzzy logic with other
% machine learning methods.
