% Discussion

\noindent
% Interpret the results in light of the hypotheses.  Discuss which features
% showed the strongest differences between human and LLM texts and how these
% findings relate to previous work on generated text detection.  Reflect on
% the usefulness of non--parametric tests and multivariate models for
% stylometric analysis.  Address potential confounding factors (e.g.
% topic variation, length differences) and limitations of the study.
% Suggest how these methods could be applied to other domains or adapted to
% new types of generative models.
