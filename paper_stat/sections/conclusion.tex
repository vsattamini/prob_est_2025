\noindent
% Summarise the main contributions of the statistical analysis.  Emphasise the
% value of interpretable features and classic statistical tools for
% understanding differences between human and machine--generated texts.  Note
% practical applications (authorship verification, model auditing) and future
% research directions (larger corpora, cross--linguistic studies, integration
% with fuzzy logic approaches).
